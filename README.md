In addition to scene templates, this repository also includes extensions for collection and table views:

3. **UICollectionView+Extension.xctemplate**
    - Incorporates extensions tailored for UICollectionView instances, enhancing their functionality and integration with MVVM architecture.

4. **UITableView+Extension.xctemplate**
